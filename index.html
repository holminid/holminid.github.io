Controlling music with your body
</h2>


The EPhysMus (Electronic Physiological Music) system is a modular, reactive audio environment for the authoring of live biomusic. 
</p>

<p>
Users of the system wear wireless biosensors that measure their biosignals, which are then translated into musical events in realtime. 
</p>

<p>
The EPhysMus software can be used to control synthesisers, effects and mixing. It supports DMX lighting and OSC-controlled visuals, which enhance the performance, as it provides a visual feedback of the biosignals and the sounds they produce. 
</p>

<p>
Measured signals include heart rate, breathing and movement. The resulting music is dynamic due to the linking of performers' biomechanical activity and postures to various parameters in the synthesis and composition of the piece. 
</p>

<p>
The project enables anyone with a pulse to create complex and expressive performances in any given musical style, in our case typically ranging from classical minimalism or no-wave symphonies to industrial ambient and EBM as well as contemporary styles.
</p>

<p>
In multi-performer sessions, users can create collaborative instruments that combine their biosignals in novel ways. Performance and composition are intrinsically linked to the physiologies and activities of the participants.
</p>

<p>
Performing electronic music live is problematic, as it is either pre-programmed or algorithmic in nature. A deeper level of interfacing with machines is required for sufficiently expressive performances. The use of biosignal measurements in a musical context creates an emergent art form enabling physical, ubiquitous, reactive music to be performed by large numbers of participants. 
</p>

<p>
Our three-man team has developed a sonification system for controlling various aspects of an electronic music performance. We use continuous inputs such as respiration to control synthesis and effect parameters. Events such as heartbeats provide a sync source for tempo and trigger scenes, samples and MIDI notes. Accelerometer-based posture measurement is typically used so that lateral movements alter the melodic structure of a piece, leaning forward is interpreted as an aggressive posture (reflected in the song’s dynamics), and leaning backwards eases the tension in the song. Bio-controlled lighting and projected visualisations are generated to augment the musical piece.
</p>

<p>
An optional “analysis supervisor” conducts the performance by assigning tasks to individual biosignal streams, which allows the musicians to focus on their performance by removing the need to constantly monitor their biosignals in relation to the piece. The analysis supervisor identifies the optimal streams to be used for synthesis or lighting control and oversees the transitions between tracks.
