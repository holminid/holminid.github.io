<h4>Controlling music with your body</h4>

<p>
Our three-man team has developed a sonification system for controlling various aspects of an electronic music performance. We use continuous inputs such as respiration to control synthesis and effect parameters. Events such as heartbeats provide a sync source for tempo and trigger scenes, samples and MIDI notes. Accelerometer-based posture measurement is typically used so that lateral movements alter the melodic structure of a piece, leaning forward is interpreted as an aggressive posture (reflected in the songâ€™s dynamics), and leaning backwards eases the tension in the song. Bio-controlled lighting and projected visualisations are generated to augment the musical piece.
